### **Assignment: Build a Text-Based Adventure Game Using Linked Lists**

#### **Objective**
Create a text-based adventure game where the player moves through different rooms in a dungeon. The dungeon's rooms will be implemented using a **Linked List**.

---

#### **Game Description**
- The player starts in the first room of the dungeon and can move **forward** or **backward** through the rooms.
- Each room will have a description and may contain challenges (like puzzles or traps) or rewards (like treasures).
- The player wins by reaching the last room and loses if their health reaches zero.

---

#### **Requirements**
1. **Classes and OOP Concepts**:
   - **Room**: Represents a single room in the dungeon.  
     Attributes:
     - `name` (e.g., "Entrance", "Treasure Room")
     - `description`
     - `next_room` (reference to the next room in the Linked List)
     - `previous_room` (reference to the previous room in the Linked List)

   - **Dungeon**: Manages the Linked List of rooms.
     Methods:
     - `add_room`: Adds a new room to the dungeon.
     - `remove_room`: Removes a room by name.
     - `navigate_forward`: Moves the player to the next room.
     - `navigate_backward`: Moves the player to the previous room.

   - **Player**: Tracks player stats.  
     Attributes:
     - `health`
     - `inventory`

2. **Gameplay**:
   - The game should start with at least 5 rooms connected in a Linked List.
   - The player can navigate between rooms using commands like `go forward` or `go backward`.
   - Display the current roomâ€™s description and allow the player to interact with it.
   - Include a small event system:
     - Traps that reduce health.
     - Treasures that can be collected into the inventory.

#### **Tools**
- **IDE**: Use VSCode.
- **Debugger**: Use VSCode's built-in debugger to test your code step-by-step.
- **Libraries**:
  - Python's `dataclasses` for simplified class definitions.
  - Use `os` or `time` for creating delays or clearing the console for better user experience (optional).

---

#### **Deliverables**
1. A Python file (`dungeon_game.py`) containing the game code.
2. The game should be playable from the terminal/console.

---

### **Hints**
- Use a **singly linked list** structure to connect rooms first, and then extend it to a **doubly linked list** if time permits.
- Focus on writing clean, modular code. Use methods to handle specific tasks like printing room details or handling player inputs.
- Test your Linked List implementation separately before integrating it into the game logic.

Once you're done, share your code here, and I'll review it for you, providing feedback on both the implementation and your understanding of the concepts. Good luck!
